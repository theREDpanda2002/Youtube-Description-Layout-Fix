# Youtube-Description-Layout-Fix
[WORK IN PROGRESS]
A Stylus script that fixes the 2021-2022 Youtube description layout to the previous 2017-2022 layout, the one that most people still have. 
Not sure why I've had it since mid 2021, but I hated it and made a fix for it. It's still pretty broken in most areas, but I'll make fixes eventually (hopefully).

Tested on Google Chrome, Probably works elsewhere.

Refer to "Code" file for installation instructions


FEATURES:
- Revives the regular video description layout for youtube.
- removes the ad to the right of the video player (if there is one, but there usually is)


BUGS:
- Clicking on video from homepage requires a reload or else the vatch page will be messed up BAD
- If you click on a video from the watch page, the red loading bar will be permanently at the top of the screen
- A blank playlist to the right of the video is always present. This is required so playlists aren't broken
- Add comment box broken (you can still comment)
- no replies to existing comments (this is because once opened it looks bad and wont go away)
- Searchbar has an uncentered perminent little "x" at the right side. It doesn't have a function. goes away if something is in the box
- Channel name missing when you click on your channel/account at the top right of the "watch video" page
- Many settings in the channel settings box (top right) break the box (they still work, albeit cumbersome) on watch video page
- Playlists don't show how many videos are in them, but they still work well.
