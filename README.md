# Youtube-Description-Layout-Fix
Fixes the 2021-2022 Youtube description layout to the previous 2017-2021 layout, the one that most people still have. Not sure why I've had it since mid 2021, but I hated it and made a fix for it. WORK IN PROGRESS, it's still pretty broken in most areas and requires reloads whenever a video is clicked on from the homepage.
